//Using the code from Exercise 9, are the left and right
//variables on lines 1 and 2 the same as the left and right
//variables on lines 10-12? Explain your reasoning.

//No they are not the same, left and right on lines 1 and 2 are local variables
//and the ones on 10-12 are global, they are declared seperately in different scopes.
